<h1 id="why-do-i-use-groff">Why do I use <em>groff</em>?</h1>
<p>To be honest I have been using <em>groff</em> for a couple of days.
However, there are two benefits I have noticed:</p>
<ol>
<li>Compilation speed</li>
<li>Clean &ldquo;code&rdquo;</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="compilation-speed">Compilation speed</h2>
<p>The benefit of compilation speed should be clear to anyone that has dealt with
a medium sized <em>Latex</em> document.
The compilation times are horrendous.
Because <em>groff</em> is more minimal by trait,
compilation times are faster by a large margin.
However, it is to be noted that I haven&rsquo;t created any large documents
with <em>groff</em> yet.</p>
<h2 id="clean-code">Clean &ldquo;code&rdquo;</h2>
<p>Although, not comparable to <em>Markdown</em>, <em>groff</em> syntax is pretty clean.
Most macros have to start at the line beginning,
which makes the code much cleaner.
&ldquo;Bolding&rdquo; and &ldquo;Italicing&rdquo; can be done inline with <strong>&quot;\fB&quot;</strong> and <strong>&quot;\fI&quot;</strong>.
Depending on the macro set being used section heading are very comparable
to Markdown headings.
For example: &ldquo;.sh [depth] [title]&rdquo; for the me-macros.</p>
<h1 id="macros">Macros</h1>
<p>There are a number of macro-sets that are installed by default:
<em>me, mm, mom, ms</em>.</p>
<p>In the beginning it might be very difficult to choose the right macro-set
for you.
If you are first getting started to use <em>groff</em>,
the <em>ms</em> macros are probably the easiest to get started with.
The reason for that is, that there are a bunch of resources about it online.</p>
<p>However, I found that the <em>me</em> macros are way cleaner and almost have the same
features.
I will probably follow up this post with an <em>me</em> tutorial.</p>
<h1 id="preprocessors">Preprocessors</h1>
<p>The power of <em>groff</em> comes from the multitude of preprocessors available.
The most important pre-installed ones are:
<em>eqn</em>, <em>refer</em>, <em>tbl</em> and <em>pic</em>.</p>
<ol>
<li><em>eqn</em>: equations support</li>
<li><em>refer</em>: bibliography support (similar to <em>bibtex</em>, etc&hellip;)</li>
<li><em>tbl</em>: table support</li>
<li><em>pic</em>: picture compiler (similar to <em>tikz</em>)</li>
</ol>
<p>Without preprocessors <em>groff</em> would probably be useless.
However, with them it is almost on par with <em>Latex</em>.</p>
<h1 id="problems">Problems</h1>
<p>Using custom fonts is kind of difficult.</p>
<p>There is no &ldquo;real&rdquo; utf-8 support. The only way utf-8 is supported is via a
pre-processor (<em>preconv</em>) that converts utf-8 to characters available
in <em>groff</em>.</p>
<p>The last 2 problems arise from <em>groff</em> being single-pass:</p>
<ol>
<li>Forward references aren&rsquo;t available by default (in most macro-sets).</li>
<li>A Table of contents can only be added to the end of the file</li>
</ol>
